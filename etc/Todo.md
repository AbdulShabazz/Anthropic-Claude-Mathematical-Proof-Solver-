This new type-instance support indeed opens up many possibilities. Here are some powerful features we could add to make our proof analysis tool more capable:

## 1. **Pattern Variables & Unification**
```
// Axioms with variables
?x:number + 0:number = ?x:number
?x:list + ?y:list = concat(?x, ?y):list
map(?f, cons(?x, ?xs)) = cons(?f(?x), map(?f, ?xs))
```
This would allow for more general axioms that can match multiple concrete instances.

## 2. **Conditional Rewrite Rules**
```
// Rules with side conditions
?x / ?y = ?x * (1/?y) :- ?y != 0
sqrt(?x * ?x) = ?x :- ?x >= 0
```
Rules that only apply when certain conditions are met.

## 3. **Proof Tactics & Strategies**
```javascript
// Custom proof strategies
strategies: {
  "simplify": ["reduce", "normalize", "eliminate_identities"],
  "induction": ["base_case", "inductive_step"],
  "contradiction": ["assume_negation", "derive_false"]
}
```
Higher-level proof strategies that combine multiple reasoning steps.

## 4. **Interactive Proof Development**
- Step-by-step proof construction
- Backtracking and exploring alternative paths
- Proof state visualization
- Hint system based on partial proofs

## 5. **Lemma Extraction & Management**
```
// Automatically extract proven statements as lemmas
Lemma: 2:integer + 2:integer = 4:integer (from proof #3)
// Reuse in future proofs with caching
```

## 6. **Advanced Type System Features**
```
// Dependent types
vector(?n:nat, ?T:type)
matrix(?m:nat, ?n:nat, ?T:type)

// Type constraints
?x:number{x > 0} + ?y:number{y > 0} = ?z:number{z > 0}

// Polymorphic types
identity : forall ?T:type. ?T -> ?T
```

## 7. **Proof Visualization**
- Graph visualization of proof steps
- Interactive proof tree exploration
- Highlight critical path in proof
- Animation of rewrite sequences

## 8. **Performance Analysis Tools**
```javascript
// Detailed profiling
{
  "hotspots": ["axiom_3 used 847 times"],
  "bottlenecks": ["state 2847 expanded 50+ children"],
  "pruning_effectiveness": "73% states pruned by heuristic"
}
```

## 9. **Counter-Example Generation**
When no proof exists, try to find a counter-example:
```
No proof found. Counter-example:
When x = 2.5:rational, left side = 5.0 but right side = 4
```

## 10. **Proof Normalization & Simplification**
- Remove redundant steps
- Combine similar transformations
- Find shorter equivalent proofs

## 11. **Theory Modules**
```
import ArithmeticTheory
import ListTheory
import SetTheory

theory CustomAlgebra extends Ring {
  // Custom axioms...
}
```

## 12. **Proof Certificates & Verification**
- Export proofs in standard formats (Coq, Lean, etc.)
- Independent proof checker
- Proof compression/decompression

## 13. **Parallel Proof Search**
- Web Workers for parallel exploration
- Distributed proof search across multiple strategies
- GPU acceleration for pattern matching

## 14. **Machine Learning Integration**
- Learn effective heuristics from successful proofs
- Predict promising axiom applications
- Auto-generate lemmas based on patterns

## 15. **Natural Language Interface**
```
"Prove that adding 1 four times equals 4"
â†’ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
```

## Implementation Priority Suggestion:

Based on your current system, I'd prioritize:

1. **Pattern Variables** - Huge expressiveness gain
2. **Lemma Management** - Reuse proven facts
3. **Proof Visualization** - Understanding complex proofs
4. **Interactive Mode** - Easier debugging and exploration
5. **Theory Modules** - Organize axioms by domain

Would you like me to implement any of these features? The pattern variables system would be particularly powerful combined with your type system!
