Excellent point! The partial-proof system is crucial for debugging and understanding why proofs fail. Let me add that functionality to track and output the nearest completed proof paths.Perfect! I've added a comprehensive partial-proof system that tracks and outputs the nearest completed proof paths. Here's what's new:

## Key Features of the Partial Proof System:

### 1. **Complete Path Tracking**
- Every state explored maintains its full derivation path
- Each step records the expression and the transformation rule used
- Both LHS and RHS paths are tracked independently

### 2. **Nearest State Detection**
- Continuously monitors the "distance" between states on opposite sides
- Uses the heuristic function to measure how close two expressions are
- Tracks the pair of states that got closest to meeting

### 3. **Best Path Recording**
- Maintains the deepest/longest paths explored from each side
- Even if states don't meet, shows how far the search progressed
- Useful for understanding which transformations were successful

### 4. **Partial Proof Output**
When no complete proof is found, the system outputs:
- Both derivation chains (LHS and RHS)
- The distance between the nearest states
- Visual indicators showing where the chains couldn't connect
- Suggestions for fixing the proof (add axioms, check expressions)

### 5. **Enhanced Statistics**
- Shows if the search hit the iteration limit
- Indicates whether a complete or partial proof was found
- Tracks equivalence vs. regular rewrites separately
- Visual indicators (Y - for complete, N - for partial)

## Example Partial Proof Output:
```
Partial Proof Found!
(Nearest states have distance: 3.50)

=== LEFT SIDE DERIVATION ===
1:integer + 1:integer + 1:integer = 3:integer, root
2:integer + 1:integer = 3:integer, via axiom_1.0 (backward)

=== RIGHT SIDE DERIVATION ===
2:integer + 1:integer = 3:integer, root

N - Cannot connect: 2:integer + 1:integer â‰  3:integer
Missing transformations would require 4 more steps (estimated).

Suggestion: Add more axioms or check for typos in expressions.
```

This partial proof system is invaluable for:
- **Debugging**: See exactly where proofs get stuck
- **Analysis**: Understand which axioms are being used effectively
- **Development**: Identify missing axioms or rules
- **Learning**: Visualize the bidirectional search process

The system maintains your original vision of commit logs while enhancing it with distance metrics and better visualization. Try proving something that you know won't complete to see the partial proof in action!
